Be careful that scrum doesn't push us into a development mode using chinese whispers. The role of PO becomes a detrimental buffer between stakeholders and developers.

Reasons
- developers feel productive because they spend more time coding
- buffer from interruptions
- buffer from ad-hoc feature requests
- buffer from human interaction

BUT
- Development is really about learning, not cranking out code
- Not understanding and developing the wrong thing is costly, even if it is just 2 weeks
