- money, interest. payment amount. graphs

costs
- speed of development adding new features
- time spent fixing bugs
- cost of mistakes, downtime, miscalculation, loss of trust

ways debt manifest
- complexity of system exceeds complexity of problem
  - overuse of patterns
  - advanced technical patterns
- mixed abstractions
- messy code
- insufficient test coverage
- model does not fit problem within context
- value stream mismatch to solution

Thought:

- if your house is messy you can clean it a little by little, one room at a time
- if you are having another kid and need an extra bedroom added, you need an architect, with a plan for the building, and a plan for when and how long this is going to take (you might need to move out).
