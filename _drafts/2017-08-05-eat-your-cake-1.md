[Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) is an awesome build automation system that allows you to code your automations in C#. It is just one of many task based build systems like [CMake](https://cmake.org), [PSake](https://github.com/psake/psake), and [FAKE](https://fake.build/) but for C# developers it has a really low barrier to entry.  

Another great thing about Cake is the enormous list of [built in tools](http://cakebuild.net/dsl/) plus a huge library of [addins](http://cakebuild.net/addins/).

## What are we going to be doing?

Throughout this series of posts we will be building a small web API project and automating the build pipeline via scripts.
