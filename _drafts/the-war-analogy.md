There is a lack amoung developers to actually know what really good development can be like
Its like war. In war you want a psychpath but a bunch of psychopaths are not going to get you to a flourishing society.
A well adjusted person could actually be a liability in war. Some developers thrive in chaos. They are productive, get shit done, but seldom move toward a much better dev environment.
