## Skills of meditation

Meditation. Often described as clearing your mind. Following your breath. Relaxing. Although the most common descriptions, these are probably the least interesting descriptions of meditation. They do not capture the rich depth of the techniques that can be found in the many contemplative traditions throughout history.

A clarifying analogue for meditation is that of physical exercise. One way of comparing exercises is by their discipline. Weightlifting vs running, yoga vs cross-fit. If you are looking for what the benefits are from these exercises, the style is less important than the specific exercises you do within them. All of these styles can be good for you but doing the exercises from each that give the biggest boost to your physical fitness is the best way of approaching them.
Meditation is the same. When comparing the different styles of meditation, the common theme is living a good life. What exactly a good life is can differ between them but this just gives us a buffet of techniques to choose from while trying to improve our own lives.

Let's look at some of the "mental muscles" you may want to target and how these techniques developed over thousands of years can help. At this point I want to say, I will be providing examples from meditation traditions I am more familiar with. This is not to say other traditions do no have techniques for cultivating your thoughts in similar ways. I do only want to talk about things I have personal experience with.

### Reducing suffering

I think we can all agree that a good place to start with living a good life is by reducing suffering. Now the word suffering can be a misleading one though as everyone has their understanding of it. Suffering can be the mental, emotional, or physical anguish that occur from traumatic events in your life. It can be from well-known sources like stress.  Another lesser-acknowledged source is from change. Everything changes and holding on to anything can be an exercise in futility, and a source of suffering.

One way that formal meditation helps alleviate suffering is by training you to recognise when you are lost in thought. We all know that feeling of remaining angry because you replay in your mind how someone wronged you. The technique often referred to as Mindfulness is the practice of observing a thought, and then bringing attention back to something like the breath. 
A common misconception of meditation is that you are trying to keep your mind free of thought. The real benefit is that each time you recognise a thought, you get to do a "rep" and practice letting go of that thought. This is the practice. We cannot in-fact control our thoughts, we can only control where we place our attention.

Epictetus, a well known Stoic philosopher, summarised the source of our suffering well: 

> "What upsets people is not things themselves, but their judgements about these things". 

And these are the types of meditations of the Stoics. They do not sit and breathe but instead meditate on the wisdom passed down to them, and their thoughts. They visualise how they want to approach situations with wisdom and courage.
One example of a Stoic practice is described by Seneca: 

> "Set aside a certain number of days during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with a coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while, ‘Is this the condition that I feared?". 

Many people fear losing everything, or not having every need met. By putting yourself in the situation and reflecting on it, the fear will often dissipate.
This brings me to one last example of a fear that many have. Fear of dying. There is a technique in some Buddhist traditions called Corpse meditation. Even back in South Africa, I could not find a corpse so I had to content myself with imagining myself dead and slowly decaying. Although it seems macabre, it familiarises you with death in a way that reduces the unknown, and so also the fear. This practice has another benefit which I will touch on later.

I will end this section with an amusing story. 
A General of an army conquers a town and then hears about a Zen master who lives nearby. The General goes to the Zen master and on not being afforded the reverence he feels he deserves, his anger rises and he draws his sword. *"Do you not realise you stand before a man who could run you through with this sword without blinking an eye?"* shouts the self-important General. Unperturbed, the Zen master responds, *"Do you not realise you are standing before a man who could be run through without blinking an eye?"*.

### Being kind to others

A common theme of philosophies that are serious about how to live well is that of treating others well. 

> "Call to mind the doctrine that rational creatures have come into the world for the sake of one another, and that tolerance is a part of justice" - Marcus Aurelius

In Buddhism, there is a technique for actively cultivating feelings of compassion for yourself and the world around you. It is the practice of Metta, otherwise known as loving-kindness. In this practice, you generate a feeling of compassion. You start with those you already have this feeling for and wish them happiness, freedom from suffering, and fulfilment in life. You then expand that to others. This may feel awkward initially but recall that our thoughts about people are just running through neural pathways. Reinforcing these pathways in positive ways can lead to new ways of thinking and feeling. 

### Finding meaning

> "Meditate often on the interconnectedness and mutual interdependence of all things in the universe. For in a sense, all things are mutually woven together and therefore have an affinity for each other." - Marcus Aurelius

We are social animals, even the more introverted ones like myself. The richness of experience is not only determined by our actions but who we share those actions with. This is easy to take for granted until you are thrust into isolation by the world being in the grip of a pandemic.

If you can, get out into open spaces. Walk around and greet any stranger you can (from a distance). Be mindful during these times and be thankful for the things you can do, the people you see, and the occasional smile you get back.

> "All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way." - Marcus Aurelius

Developing a practice of being thankful daily for every little thing you can muster will provide a bulwark against the bad things that come your way.

I said I would come back to the meditation on death. By considering that any day could be your last, it can bring into focus what is important and what your energy should be spent on.

> “Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.” - Seneca

No only can meditating on your own mortality make sure you spend your time well, it can cause you to appreciate life more.

### Conclusion

I hope I have convinced you that there is more to meditation than following the next breath. To be clear, this practice of Mindfulness is an important part of the whole. It provides the foundation of focus and awareness of distraction that is critical for many other techniques.

Taking that foundation and layering other practices from other traditions can provide a holistic collection of techniques that add practical knowledge that can be honed into practical skills.

One last thing. Just like the fear of death can be lessened by analysis of it, so the journey toward happiness is an analysis of your mind. The more you observe how it works, the more you can steer it towards your goals. 

Once you have control, only then can you decide where to go.
