I have spent a fair amount of time lately thinking about the different types of metrics that are captured in a software development project. This includes what metrics are valuable to measure, which are feasible to capture, and how they should be used. Although I will talk about what metrics, I will not talk about feasibility or capture in this post, as really each metric could be a post on it's own. What I will talk about in this post is how I think about these metrics in terms of usage within an organization.

A common problem I see around metrics and logging is that there is seldom a coordinated plan around what to measure, and why.
