I feel like there has been a move in terms of thought leaders away from achievement and value add toward stickiness of ideas. This I guess is a consequence of social media.

Stickiness of ideas has very little to do with them being factually correct. All they need is to be sticky to the world view we currently have.
An idea that is sticky to our hardware, so our very human nature, would stick easily. Then subsequent ideas that reinforce that idea would stick to that and this is how a completely untrue body of "knowledge" or belief could grow up. Of course each of these ideas would need to have some utility as a group of ideas. Utility does not mean correct though. Things that have value or utility to our psyche but arguably add real value:

- Ideas that make decisions simple to make in a complex environment (without tending to improve the correctness of the decision)
- Ideas that make you feel to superior to another person or group
- Ideas that make you feel safe or comfortable
