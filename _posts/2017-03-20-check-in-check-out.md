Someone must have thought of this before but I have not read this anywhere so I thought I would jot it down. I recently ran a retrospective that I thought went really well, and apparently so did everyone else...

# Measure with Check-in and Check-out

if you don't measure something how can you know if it improving? It is a staple of development so why shouldn't we apply it to our meetings as well. It is really easy.

1. At the start of the retrospective ask everyone to write down a single word (or phrase) that sums up there feeling about how things are going
2. Do your retrospective
3. Repeat step 1 at the end of the retrospective and see if anything changed

Easy!
