# Project Context

## Purpose
This repository stores the source for Devon Burriss' static blog. The goal is to publish essays and tutorials focused on software development, functional programming, testing practices, and technical leadership. Contributors manage Markdown content and shared theme assets that Pretzel transforms into the production site.

## Tech Stack
- Pretzel static site generator (Liquid engine, .NET)
- Cake build scripts (`pretzel.cake`, `pretzel.ps1`) for bake/serve workflows
- Markdown posts with YAML front matter for metadata and routing
- Liquid layouts (`_layouts/`) and partials (`_includes/`)
- Bootstrap, custom Less/CSS, and Highlight.js for styling and code samples
- jQuery-based enhancements and local JavaScript utilities under `js/`

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Posts live in `_posts/` and follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` naming convention with YAML front matter describing `layout`, `title`, `tags`, `permalink`, and `excerpt_separator`.
- Drafts remain under `_drafts/` until published; move to `_posts/` and set `published: true` once finalized.
- Favor semantic Markdown headings over raw HTML; wrap lines naturally around ~100 characters but prioritize readability over strict width limits.
- Keep styles, scripts, and images in their respective directories (`css/`, `js/`, `img/`, `fonts/`) and avoid embedding inline assets inside Markdown posts.
- Liquid includes in `_includes/` should stay self-contained to support reuse across layouts.

### Architecture Patterns
- Pretzel renders the site using Liquid layouts and includes, combining front matter metadata with `_config.yml` settings.
- Custom Pretzel plugins ship as pre-built DLLs in `_plugins/` and are loaded during the bake.
- Cake tasks orchestrate builds: `Bake` produces production output, while `Taste` runs a local preview via `pretzel taste --port <port>`.
- The `Prepare` helper in `pretzel.cake` toggles `url` and `is_production` values in `_config.yml` to match Debug or Release builds.
- Generated artifacts land in `_site/` and should not be committed to the `source` branch.

### Testing Strategy
- No automated tests currently; CI validates that the Pretzel bake completes successfully.
- Preview changes locally with `./pretzel.ps1 -Target Taste -Configuration Debug` (or the `run.ps1` wrapper) to confirm layout, links, and code formatting before pushing.
- Manually spot-check new includes or plugins in multiple viewports during local preview sessions.

### Git Workflow
- Author content and theme changes on the `source` branch; AppVeyor builds this branch and force-pushes the generated `_site` to `master` for hosting.
- Use short-lived feature branches for substantial updates, rebasing or squashing before merging into `source`.
- Write descriptive commit messages referencing the post or asset touched. Add `[skip appveyor]` when commits should not trigger deployment.
- Submodules are refreshed via `git submodule update --remote` during CI, so keep submodule pointers clean.

## Domain Context
The blog explores professional software development topics, with emphasis on .NET tooling, F#, testing strategies, architecture, telemetry, and team leadership. Expect terminology from functional programming, DevOps observability, and agile process discussions.

## Important Constraints
- `pretzel.cake` assumes Pretzel is installed at `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\pretzel\tools\Pretzel.exe`; update the script if the path changes.
- `_config.yml` is auto-adjusted between Debug and Release builds; avoid committing manual toggles of `url` or `is_production`.
- Only ship plugins compatible with the Pretzel version installed via Chocolatey; replacing DLLs requires validating the CI build.
- CI runs on the AppVeyor Visual Studio 2015 Windows image, so cross-platform scripts must account for PowerShell/Cake expectations.
- Production analytics and comments depend on configured Google Analytics and Disqus identifiers.

## External Dependencies
- AppVeyor CI for building and deploying from `source` to the published branch.
- GitHub Pages hosting via the `master` branch generated by CI.
- Pretzel static site generator and Liquid templating engine.
- Disqus (`devonburriss`) for comments and Google Analytics (`UA-45750611-2`).
- Bundled Bootstrap, jQuery, and Highlight.js libraries that power the theme and interactions.
